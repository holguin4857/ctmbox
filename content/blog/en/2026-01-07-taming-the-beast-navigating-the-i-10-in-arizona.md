## Introduction

If you drive in Arizona, you have a love-hate relationship with Interstate 10. It is the primary artery connecting California to the East Coast, but for local Arizona trucking, it is a daily gauntlet of construction, extreme weather, and unpredictable traffic.

At CTM, we run these routes daily. We know that efficient logistics means respecting the road conditions. Here is what every professional driver needs to keep in mind as we head into the new year.

## The "Danger Zone": Phoenix to Tucson

The stretch between Eloy and Picacho Peak isn't just boring—it’s deadly. This area is notorious for **Haboobs** (sudden dust storms) that can drop visibility to zero in seconds.

- **The Tech:** Watch for ADOT’s variable speed limit signs. If they drop from 75 to 35, it’s not a suggestion; it’s a warning that the air ahead is thick with dust.
- **The Rule:** If you can’t see, pull off _completely_. Turn off your lights and take your foot off the brake. If you leave your lights on, a car following you might think you are still moving and rear-end you.

## Mastering the Broadway Curve

The massive construction project on the Broadway Curve is finally settling down, but the new layout can still confuse drivers who haven't run it recently. The new **Collector-Distributor (CD) roads** are designed to separate through-traffic from locals.

If you are just passing through Phoenix, stay in the mainlines. If you have a drop in Tempe or near the airport, commit to the CD lanes early. Last-minute lane changes here are a recipe for an accident—and a guaranteed way to get a ticket.

## Heat and Tires

Even in January, the I-10 eats tires. The pavement temperature often exceeds the air temperature by 30-40 degrees. Under-inflation is the enemy. A tire that runs cool in Flagstaff might blow out once you hit the pavement in Casa Grande. Check your pressures before you hit the flats.

## Conclusion

**We know the I-10 isn't just a line on a map—it's a living, breathing challenge.** At CTM, we prioritize safety and precision in every mile we cover. Stay safe out there, keep your eyes on the horizon, and follow our page for more industry updates and Arizona logistics news.
