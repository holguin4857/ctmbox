## Introduction

As the sun sets on 2025, we want to take a moment to pause and reflect. In the logistics world, we are often so focused on the _next_ load that we forget to appreciate the miles we have already traveled.

This year was not without its challenges. The freight market tested everyone—shippers and carriers alike. But through tight capacity, fluctuating rates, and cross-border complexities, our team and our partners stood firm.

## To Our Customers

Thank you for trusting CTM with your most critical freight. Whether it was a Just-In-Time automotive shipment or a high-value industrial move, your trust is the fuel that drives our business. We do not take your partnership for granted.

## To Our Drivers

You are the heartbeat of CTM. While the rest of the world sleeps, you are out there on the I-10 and the I-19 ensuring the supply chain never breaks. Thank you for your professionalism, your safety, and your dedication.

## Looking Ahead

We are closing this year stronger than we started. We wish you and your families a Happy New Year filled with health, prosperity, and safe miles. See you in 2026!
