## Introduction

It is the most dreaded hour in the logistics industry: Friday afternoon at 3:00 PM. For many shippers, this is when the "Ghosting" begins. You have freight that must move before the weekend, but suddenly, the carrier you booked on Tuesday isn't answering the phone.

In 2026, overbooking has become a common tactic for national fleets looking to maximize their weekend revenue. If a higher-paying load appears at the last minute, they "ghost" their original commitment, leaving you stranded on the dock.

## The True Cost of a Friday No-Show

A Friday cancellation isn't just a minor delay; it is a financial bottleneck:

- **Weekend Storage Fees:** If that freight doesn't move, it sits. You pay for the space it occupies and the delay in your customer's hands.
- **The Spot Market Panic:** Shippers desperate to move weekend freight often end up paying 20-30% above market rates just to find a truck that will actually show up.
- **Facility Overtime:** Your warehouse team stays late, waiting for a truck that is never coming.

## The CTM 'Finish Strong' Commitment

Our **Managing Member**, Roy, built CTM on a simple principle: A commitment on Tuesday is just as binding at 5:00 PM on a Friday. We don't overbook our units, and we don't "rate-shop" our existing partners' loads.

When you book with CTM, you get:

1. **Capacity Certainty:** Our asset-based model means when we say we have a truck, we have a truck.
2. **End-of-Week Accountability:** We prioritize Friday clearances to ensure our partners can head into the weekend with an empty dock and a clear mind.
3. **Professional Continuity:** We don't pass your load to a third party. The driver who is scheduled is the driver who arrives.

## Conclusion

Don't let "Friday Freight Fails" become a routine part of your supply chain. In a market where reliability is the rarest commodity, CTM remains the partner that finishes the week as strong as we started it.
