## Introduction

The industrial heartbeat of North America connects the manufacturing giants of the Midwest ("The Rust Belt") with the assembly plants of Sonora, Mexico. For automotive and industrial shippers in **Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan**, getting components to the border efficiently is critical.

At **CTM**, we don't just "service" this lane; we specialize in it.

## The CTM Advantage: Midwest to Nogales

While other carriers shy away from the long haul, we have optimized our operations for the 1,800+ mile run from the Midwest to Arizona.

- **Dedicated Assets:** We run our own trucks on this lane. This means we aren't posting your load to a board hoping a stranger picks it up.
- **Team Service Available:** For Just-In-Time (JIT) manufacturing lines, we offer team drivers to cut transit time significantly.
- **Direct to Border:** We feed directly into the Nogales port of entry, bypassing the congestion often found in Texas crossings.

## Why Shippers Choose This Route

Many shippers default to sending Midwest freight through Laredo, Texas. But for destination plants in **Sonora (Hermosillo, Guaymas, Nogales)**, routing through Arizona is often faster and more secure.

By utilizing the CTM network, you get a straight shot from the factory floor in Indiana to the maquiladora in Mexico.

## Conclusion

If your supply chain relies on connecting the Midwest to Mexico, trust the carrier that owns the trucks on the road. Contact CTM to quote your Indiana-Arizona lane today.
