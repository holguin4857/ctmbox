## Introduction

The "Maquiladora" industry in Sonora is booming, driven by Nearshoring. But a factory is only as efficient as the trucks that feed it. If raw materials sit at the border, machines stop running.

At **CTM**, we have tailored our operations specifically to support the high-pressure environment of Cross-Border Manufacturing.

## We Speak "Plant Manager"

We know that for our clients in Hermosillo, Guaymas, and Nogales, a "late load" isn't just an inconvenience—it's a KPI failure.

- **Sync with Production:** We align our transit times with your production shifts.
- **Trailer Pools:** We drop empty trailers at your dock so your loading crew can work efficiently, without waiting for a driver to back in.
- **Visibility:** We provide updates that you can actually trust, so your planning team isn't left guessing.

## The Arizona Corridor Advantage

By utilizing the Arizona corridor, we connect the US supply base directly to the factory door. We handle the consolidation in Tucson/Nogales and ensure a smooth handoff across the border, acting as the conveyor belt between countries.

## Conclusion

You focus on manufacturing world-class products. Let CTM focus on getting the parts to your door. We are the engine behind the assembly line.
