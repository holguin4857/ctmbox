## Introduction

Precision in logistics usually focuses on highway miles and delivery windows. However, some of the most significant delays occur after a truck has already arrived at the destination address. When a GPS leads a 53-foot trailer to a locked employee gate or a front office instead of the shipping dock, the result is wasted time, increased fuel burn, and unnecessary stress for everyone involved.

At CTM, we have spent the last year optimizing our Arizona routes. We have found that the most efficient shippers are those who provide a "digital breadcrumb trail" for the driver. Here is how shippers can help us move their freight faster by improving their last-mile directions.

## The Google Profile Fix

Most drivers use Google Maps for initial navigation. The problem is that a standard business address pin usually defaults to the front door. For a warehouse, the truck entrance is often on an entirely different street.

We recommend that shippers claim their Google Business Profile and add a specific "Truck Entrance" photo or note. Even better, providing the exact GPS coordinates for the gate—rather than just the street address—allows the driver to route directly to the point of impact.

## Simple Reference Lines

Roy, our lead operator, notes that directions do not need to be complex to be effective. Simple, clear reference lines in the dispatch notes can save twenty minutes of confusion. Examples include:

- "Truck entrance is 200 yards past the main light, second gate on the right."
- "Follow the blue signs for Shipping and Receiving; do not enter through the visitor lot."
- "Dock 4 is the third door from the north end of the building."

## The Power of Positioning

If your facility has a complex yard layout, sending a "pinned location" or a screenshot of the satellite view with the dock circled is the gold standard of communication. When a driver knows exactly how to approach the dock—whether it is a blind-side back or a straight pull-through—they can position the vehicle safely on the first attempt.

## Conclusion

Efficiency is a collaborative effort. When shippers provide precise, dock-specific directions, it allows CTM to do what we do best: deliver safely and on time. Small adjustments in communication lead to massive gains in operational reliability.
