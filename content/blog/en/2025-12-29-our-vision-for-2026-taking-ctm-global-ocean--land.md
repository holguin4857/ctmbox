## Introduction

We don't believe in standing still. In logistics, if you aren't growing, you are falling behind. As we enter 2026, CTM is executing a bold strategy to evolve from a regional carrier into a global logistics partner.

Our mission in 2026 is to help our local manufacturers find foreign markets. Here is our roadmap for the next 12 months.

## 1. Expanding to Ocean Freight

The biggest change for 2026? We are hitting the water.
We are actively incurring into the **Ocean Freight Forwarding** market to support exporters in Sonora and Arizona who want to sell their products overseas.

- **Direct Liner Accounts:** We are opening direct accounts with major Shipping Liners to secure competitive container space.
- **Customs Partnerships:** We are finalizing partnerships with specialized Customs Agents to handle the complexities of international exports.
- **The Goal:** To offer a true "Door-to-Port" solution—picking up your product and managing it all the way to a port in Asia or Europe.

## 2. Digitalizing Our Fleet (Asset-Based)

While we expand our ocean freight division, we aren't forgetting our roots. We are investing heavily in digital fleet management tools to maximize the efficiency and reliability of our trucks for the "First Mile" and "Last Mile."

- **Goal:** 100% real-time visibility and optimized scheduling on the critical lanes that feed the ports (like Guaymas or Long Beach).
- **Benefit:** You get smarter, more reliable capacity. We ensure the truck is exactly where it needs to be.

## 3. The Tucson Terminal as a Hub

Our property at **791 E Evans Blvd** will serve as the consolidation point for this new global strategy. It will act as the staging hub where LTL loads can be consolidated into Ocean Containers, leveraging the benefits of our strategic location.

## Conclusion

2026 is the year CTM goes beyond borders. Whether it's by truck or by ship, we are ready to move your business forward.
