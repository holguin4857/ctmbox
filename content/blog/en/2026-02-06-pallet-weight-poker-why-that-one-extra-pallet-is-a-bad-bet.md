## Introduction

We’ve all been there. The dock is almost clear, but there is one pallet left. The temptation is to "squeeze it in" and hope the scales are forgiving. In the logistics industry, we call this **Pallet Weight Poker.** But in 2026, the house always wins, and the "ante" has never been higher.

At CTM, we don't play games with your freight. When it comes to weight limits and the Arizona Bridge Law, we know that "close enough" is a recipe for a logistical disaster.

## The Cost of the Gamble

Attempting to move an overweight load isn't just a minor infraction; it is a high-cost gamble that impacts your bottom line:

- **Hefty Fines:** Roadside enforcement in Arizona has become increasingly automated. An overweight violation can easily trigger fines ranging from $500 to over $2,500, depending on the severity.
- **The 'Grounded' Shipment:** If a truck is found to be significantly overweight, it is often grounded at the scale. You then have to pay for a second truck to come out and offload the excess—doubling your shipping costs instantly.
- **Safety & Wear:** Excessive weight puts undue stress on brakes and tires, increasing the risk of a catastrophic failure on the I-10.

## The Roy Standard: Professional Integrity

Our **Managing Member**, Roy, takes a firm stance on weight compliance. We believe that a professional carrier’s job is to protect the shipper from themselves.

1. **Pre-Load Verification:** We work with your dock team to verify weights before the doors are closed. We would rather have a difficult conversation at the dock than a disaster at the weigh station.
2. **Bridge Law Expertise:** We understand the complex spacing requirements of the Arizona Bridge Law. We don't just look at the total weight; we look at how that weight is distributed across the axles.
3. **Capacity Honesty:** If a load is too heavy for a single unit, we tell you upfront. We value your schedule and your reputation too much to "hope for the best" at the scales.

## Conclusion

In 2026, reliability is built on compliance. By refusing to play "Pallet Weight Poker," CTM ensures that your freight arrives on time, without the "hidden tax" of fines or delays. When we say it’s loaded, you can trust it’s loaded legally.
