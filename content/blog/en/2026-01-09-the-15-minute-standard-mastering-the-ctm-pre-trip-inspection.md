## Introduction

In the Arizona heat, every minute spent on the asphalt counts. However, rushing your pre-trip inspection is the fastest way to find yourself sitting on the shoulder of the I-10 or facing a heavy fine at a weigh station.

At CTM, we’ve spent the last year refining a systematic approach that ensures safety without wasting time. We call it the **15-Minute Standard**. Here is how to master it.

## The CTM "Clockwise" Method

Speed comes from consistency. By following a strict clockwise path around your rig, you eliminate the "Did I check that?" second-guessing.

### 1. The Engine Compartment (3 Minutes)

Open the hood. Look for the "ABC" of rubber: **Abrasions, Bulges, and Cuts.** \* Check your fluid levels (Oil, Coolant, Power Steering).

- Inspect the belts—ensure there is no more than 3/4 inch of play.
- Look for puddles under the engine; in Arizona, a small leak becomes a big problem once the pavement hits 120°F.

### 2. The Exterior Walk-Around (5 Minutes)

Start at the driver's side door and move forward.

- **Tires:** Don't just "thump" them. Use a gauge. Ensure steer tires have 4/32" tread depth and drives have 2/32".
- **Brakes:** Check your air lines and glad hands. Listen for the hiss.
- **Coupling:** Ensure there is no gap between the fifth wheel and the apron. If you see daylight, you aren't ready to roll.

### 3. The Light & Signal Test (3 Minutes)

Clean your lenses. Dust from the desert can dim your visibility by 50%. Test every signal: high beams, four-ways, and brake lights.

### 4. The In-Cab & Brake Test (4 Minutes)

This is where most drivers fail an inspection.

- Perform your **Applied Pressure Test**: With the engine off and brakes released, you shouldn't lose more than 3 PSI in one minute (4 PSI for a combination).
- Test your low-air warning buzzer and ensure the protection valves pop out at the correct PSI (usually around 20-40 PSI).

## Conclusion

A 15-minute investment saves you 4 hours of roadside downtime. At CTM, we take pride in our equipment because we take pride in our drivers.
