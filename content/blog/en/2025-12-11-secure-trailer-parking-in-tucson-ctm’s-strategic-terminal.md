## Introduction

Finding a spot to park a 53-foot trailer in Tucson is getting harder every day. The truck stops are jammed, and many industrial lots are too cramped to maneuver safely.

**CTM has the solution.** We have opened up our spacious yard at **791 E Evans Blvd, Tucson, AZ 85713** for carriers and owner-operators who need reliable parking or trailer storage.

## Spacious & Accessible

Forget about tight squeezes and blind-side backing into tiny spots. Our Evans Blvd facility is designed for big rigs.

- **Wide Open Lot:** Plenty of room to pull through, turn around, and park without stress.
- **Easy Access:** Located just off the main industrial corridors, getting in and out is a breeze.
- **Capacity:** Whether you have one truck or need to drop multiple trailers, we have the square footage to accommodate you.

## Flexible Storage Solutions

We offer simple, no-nonsense terms for your equipment.

- **Daily & Monthly Parking:** Need a spot for the night or a home base for the month? We have plans for both.
- **Trailer Staging:** Perfect for carriers who need to drop a loaded or empty trailer in Tucson before the next leg of the journey.

## Location Matters

We are strategically positioned near I-10 and I-19, making us the perfect midway point for freight moving between Phoenix, El Paso, and the Nogales border. Stop wasting fuel driving across town just to find a spot.
