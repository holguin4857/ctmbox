## Introduction

In the world of logistics, we often talk about the cost per mile. But in 2026, the most expensive miles are often the last 100 yards. When a driver spends 15 to 20 minutes circling a facility due to vague directions or navigating to the wrong gate, it triggers an "Invisible Tax" that impacts every level of your operation.

At CTM, we don't just view these delays as a driver's inconvenience. We view them as a systemic failure in dock throughput. When a truck is out of position, your team is idle, your fuel burn increases, and your delivery windows begin to slip.

## The Math Behind the Minute

Consider the impact of a simple 15-minute delay at the gate across 50 loads per month:

- **Idle Labor:** Your warehouse team loses 750 minutes of productive loading time while waiting for a truck to find the correct dock.
- **Fuel Waste:** Excessive idling and low-speed maneuvering in the yard increase fuel consumption and wear on equipment.
- **Opportunity Cost:** Those 15 minutes are often the difference between a driver making their next pickup or being forced into an 10-hour reset due to Hours of Service (HOS) limits.

## Roy’s Efficiency Audit

Our Managing Member, Roy, emphasizes that most of these costs are avoidable. By implementing a "Gate-to-Dock" precision plan, shippers can reclaim this lost revenue.

1. **The GPS Audit:** Ensure your facility's "Truck Entrance" is pinned accurately on commercial navigation systems, not just the front office.
2. **Standardized Reference Lines:** Dispatch notes should include specific landmarks (e.g., "Pass the blue silo, turn left at Gate 3").
3. **Visual Cues:** High-contrast signage at the entrance prevents drivers from entering employee-only lots, which are often impossible to turn a 53-foot trailer around in.

## Conclusion

Efficiency is not found in the fast lane; it is found in the transition. By eliminating the search time at the gate, CTM and our partners can achieve a higher standard of operational excellence. Helping your driver find the dock isn't just a courtesy—it's an investment in your bottom line.
