## Introduction

When choosing a port of entry, most shippers look at speed. But smart shippers also look at **tax strategy**. Nogales isn't just a border crossing; it is home to **Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) #60**, a designated area that offers massive financial advantages for international trade.

## What is FTZ #60?

Covering the entirety of Santa Cruz County, FTZ #60 is strategically positioned at the gateway of the CANAMEX corridor. It serves as a logistics hub connecting the manufacturing power of Mexico (Sonora) with the consumption markets of the Western US.

## Key Benefits for Shippers

Utilizing the FTZ in Nogales can directly impact your bottom line:

- **Duty Deferral:** You don't pay U.S. Customs duties until the goods leave the zone and enter the U.S. market. If you export them again, you pay **zero** duties.
- **Inverted Tariffs:** If you manufacture inside the zone, you may pay a lower duty rate on the finished product than on the raw materials.
- **Logistical Speed:** The Mariposa Port of Entry recently underwent a $244 million expansion, making it one of the most efficient high-tech ports on the border.

## Why Nogales?

With 85% of commercial trucks between Mexico and Arizona passing through Mariposa, the infrastructure is built for volume. Whether you need cold storage for produce or dry warehousing for industrial parts, Nogales has the "shovel-ready" land and the expertise to support it.

## Conclusion

CTM helps shippers leverage the Nogales advantage. Don't just move your freight; optimize it with the right port strategy.
