## Introduction

The Department of Transportation (DOT) and FMCSA regulations are evolving rapidly in 2026. With the transition toward the Unified Registration System (URS) and a massive overhaul of the CSA scoring system scheduled for February, "winging it" is no longer an option for Arizona carriers.

At CTM, we’ve been operating for over a year with a "safety-first" mindset. Here is the breakdown of what you need to track this year to avoid fines and stay on the road.

## 1. The Clearinghouse Crackdown

Starting recently, the FMCSA has closed the loop on the Drug & Alcohol Clearinghouse. Drivers with a "prohibited" status no longer just lose their ability to drive for a specific company their CDL/CLP is now downgraded or revoked by the state DMV automatically.

- **The Action:** Run your annual limited queries now. Do not wait for an audit to find out one of your operators is ineligible.

## 2. CSA Scoring Overhaul (February 2026)

The way your safety data is calculated is changing. The new system simplifies severity weights and focuses on a 12-month violation window.

- **The Action:** Monitor your BASIC scores monthly. Under the new system, even small, repeated violations (like a light out) can trigger an intervention much faster than before.

## 3. Digitizing the DQF (Driver Qualification Files)

Paper files are becoming a liability. In 2026, the DOT is moving toward electronic medical certificate verification and digital record-keeping.

- **The Action:** Ensure your DQFs include the new electronic medical exam data. CTM recommends centralizing these files in a cloud-based portal to ensure nothing expires without an alert.

## 4. Electronic DVIR Acceptance

The FMCSA is finalizing rules that clarify the full acceptance of electronic Driver Vehicle Inspection Reports (DVIRs).

- **The Action:** If you haven’t moved to a digital inspection system yet, now is the time. It eliminates the "lost paperwork" excuse during a roadside inspection.

## Conclusion

Compliance is a moving target, but it is the foundation of a successful logistics operation. At CTM, we don't just follow the rules; we stay ahead of them to ensure our fleet remains the most reliable in Arizona.
