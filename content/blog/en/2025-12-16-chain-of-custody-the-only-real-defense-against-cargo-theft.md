## Introduction

Cargo theft along the US-Mexico border is reaching record levels. The days of "load it and forget it" are over. Today, organized criminal groups target freight that is left unattended or handed off to unvetted carriers.

For shippers, the biggest risk isn't just the border crossing—it's the **"Blind Handoff"** that happens when traditional brokers shuffle your load between three different companies.

## The "Blind Handoff" Problem

When you book with a non-asset broker, they often post your load to a digital board.

- **The Risk:** You might get a driver with a clean record, or you might get a "Chameleon Carrier" (a fraudulent carrier hiding under a new name).
- **The Gap:** Once the freight crosses the border, many brokers lose visibility until it reaches the final warehouse. That "black hole" is where theft happens.

## The CTM Solution: Chain of Custody

At **CTM**, we operate differently. Because we are **Asset-Based**, we maintain a strict **Chain of Custody**.

1.  **Vetted Drivers:** We don't hire strangers off the internet. Our drivers are CTM employees or long-term partner carriers we have vetted for years.
2.  **Yard Security:** If a load needs to stop in Tucson, it doesn't sit at a truck stop. It sits in our **Evans Blvd Yard**, under our supervision.
3.  **Direct Communication:** Dispatch speaks directly to the driver in the cab. No middleman. No "I'll call you back."

## Conclusion

In a high-risk market, you can't afford to gamble. Don't just pay for transportation; pay for peace of mind. Ship with the carrier that owns the process.
