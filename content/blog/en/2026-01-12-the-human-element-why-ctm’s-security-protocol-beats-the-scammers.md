## Introduction

In 2026, cargo theft has gone digital. "Strategic theft" where scammers pose as legitimate carriers is at an all-time high. But at CTM, we’ve found that the best defense isn't just an app; it's a rigorous, disciplined protocol.

We’ve been operating from Arizona for more than 15 years and our safety record is built on a simple philosophy: **Verify everything. Assume nothing.**

## Why Scammers Target Arizona

The I-10 corridor is a prime target for fraudulent pick-ups. Scammers rely on busy warehouses and rushed drivers to "slip through" with forged paperwork. Once the freight is on the wrong truck, it’s gone.

## The CTM Three-Point Protocol

At CTM, we protect your freight by sticking to a strict verification process that technology alone can't replicate:

1. **Driver-to-Dispatch Chain:** We maintain a closed loop of communication. Our drivers are in constant contact with dispatch, ensuring that any deviation from the original plan is flagged immediately.
2. **Physical Asset Verification:** We don't just send "a truck." We send a specific, vetted CTM unit. Our drivers are trained to ensure that warehouse staff verify their CDL and equipment plates against the manifest before a single pallet is loaded.
3. **Red-Flag Awareness:** Scammers often try to "reroute" a load mid-journey. Our team is trained to recognize these digital traps. We never change a destination without direct, multi-channel confirmation from our clients.

## Conclusion

Security isn't about the flashiest software only it's about the strongest discipline. When you ship with CTM, you are shipping with a team that takes the safety of your cargo personally.
