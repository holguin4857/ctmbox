## Introduction

In international logistics, speed is irrelevant if your paperwork is flawed. You can have the fastest trucks and the best drivers, but a single clerical error on a customs document can ground your shipment at the Mariposa Port of Entry for days.

At CTM, we treat compliance as a competitive advantage. When paperwork is perfect, the border becomes invisible. When it’s not, it becomes a wall. Here are the three most common administrative errors that cause unnecessary delays between Sonora and Arizona.

## 1. The "Carta Porte" Mismatch

Since the Mexican SAT (Tax Administration Service) introduced the *Complemento Carta Porte* requirements, this has become the number one reason for stalled freight on the Mexican side before it even reaches US Customs.

The error often lies in the details:
* **Inconsistent Data:** The weight declared on the Bill of Lading (BOL) does not match the weight listed on the Carta Porte.
* **Route Errors:** The declared route does not match the actual GPS path of the truck.

**The Fix:** We ensure that all digital tax documents are validated against the physical load before the driver turns the key.

## 2. Incorrect HS Codes (Tariff Classification)

The Harmonized System (HS) code tells US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) exactly what your product is. A vague or outdated code triggers "red flags" in the CBP system.

* **Example:** Labeling a complex automotive assembly simply as "Auto Parts."
* **The Consequence:** This often leads to a "manifest hold" or an intensive exam (VACIS), where the truck must be unloaded and inspected manually.

**The Fix:** Precision is key. We work with customs brokers to verify that your HS codes match the specific materials and function of your cargo.

## 3. Commercial Invoice Discrepancies

The Commercial Invoice is the "source of truth" for the transaction. A common issue arises when the invoice travels separately from the freight or is updated last minute without notifying the carrier.

If the invoice lists 10 pallets but the packing list says 12, the truck stops. If the value declared for insurance differs from the value declared for duties, the truck stops.

## Conclusion: Prevention is Cheaper than Storage

The cost of a customs delay isn't just the daily storage fee; it's the broken promise to your customer.

At CTM, we don't just drive trucks; we manage the information flow. We review documentation *before* pickup to ensure a "green light" crossing every time.
