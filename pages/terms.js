            <strong>2.1. CTM Acts Solely as Agent.</strong> The Shipper
            acknowledges and agrees that in performing the Services, CTM acts

            is at all times directly between the Shipper and the underlying
            Carrier. CTM&apos;s responsibility is limited to the diligent and

          <p>
            The governing transport document for the carriage of the Goods shall
            be the Master Bill of Lading (MBL) or other similar transport
            document issued by the actual Carrier. The Shipper and Consignee
            shall be named on the MBL, and their rights and obligations, as well

            and conditions set forth in the Carrier&apos;s MBL and applicable

            Shipper, including but not limited to, cargo description, weight,
            dimensions, piece count, commodity codes, hazardous material

          <p>
            <strong>5.2. Indemnification.</strong> The Shipper shall indemnify

            losses, damages, fines, penalties, and expenses (including
            reasonable attorneys&apos; fees) arising from any inaccuracy,
            omission, or misrepresentation in the information provided by the
            Shipper or from the Shipper&apos;s failure to comply with any
            applicable laws or regulations.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Cargo Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>6.1. Written Instruction Required.</strong> CTM has no
            obligation to arrange for cargo insurance. CTM will only arrange for

            so prior to the commencement of transit.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>6.2. CTM Not an Insurer.</strong> If CTM arranges for
            insurance pursuant to the Shipper&apos;s written instructions, it
            does so as an agent for the Shipper. CTM is not an insurance
            provider, broker, or underwriter. The insurance is subject to the
            terms, conditions, and exclusions of the policy issued by the
            insurance company.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>6.3. Cargo at Shipper&apos;s Risk.</strong> In the absence
            of such written instructions to obtain insurance, the Goods shall be
            deemed to be uninsured by CTM, and the Shipper assumes all risk of
            loss or damage, subject only to the limited liability of the
            underlying Carrier as may be provided in the Carrier’s MBL.

            not be liable for any loss, damage, expense, or delay to the Goods

            circumstances shall CTM be liable for any indirect, consequential,
            or special damages, including but not limited to, lost profits, loss
            of market, or loss of business opportunity, even if CTM had
